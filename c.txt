Health service customers currently use Jenkins, which runs on a backend Rancher Kubernetes cluster, to execute their development pipelines with the help of specialized libraries that simplify complex tasks. The previous strategic library, CNP, was incompatible with the new Cloudbees Core v2 Jenkins platform, prompting the creation of a new, unified library that merges the best features of both the CNP and Conduit libraries. This single, future-proof library is designed to run seamlessly on the upgraded platform, providing a stable and strategic solution for all customers to leverage.
