The Recommended Strategy: One Dashboard per Service
Instead of one giant dashboard with internal "folders," the standard approach is to build multiple, focused dashboards. This method is far more manageable and performs better.

Your dashboard list in CloudWatch would look something like this:

EC2-Health-Dashboard

RDS-Performance-Dashboard

Lambda-Errors-Dashboard

ELB-Request-Count-Dashboard

This approach gives you a clean, at-a-glance view for each service, which is easier to navigate and maintain than a single, overloaded dashboard.
