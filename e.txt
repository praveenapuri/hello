InstanceID → You’ll likely have more instances (scale-out) to stay under per-instance EBS bandwidth/IOPS caps. Expect the number of distinct InstanceIDs to increase.

VolumeID → You’ll attach more volumes overall (and often per instance) to stripe for performance and capacity. Row count grows.

Size(GB) → Increases to hold the larger hot dataset, indexes, and logs—unless you aggressively tier most data to S3. Plan headroom (+25–30%).

Type → May change. Many teams move some workloads from gp3 to io2/io2 Block Express for tighter latency and higher IOPS at scale. Others keep gp3 but stripe more volumes.

IOPS → Increases roughly with peak active users × ops per txn / avg I/O size. If IOPS demand exceeds a single volume’s limit, you’ll raise provisioned IOPS and/or add more striped volumes.

Throughput(MB) → Increases with bigger sequential scans, compactions, reindexes, and batch jobs. If a single gp3 (up to 1,000 MB/s) isn’t enough, stripe and/or scale out across instances.

AZ → The distribution broadens as you spread load and storage across multiple AZs (and possibly additional Regions) for resilience and quota headroom.

Encrypted → Should remain the same (usually true). Not impacted by scale—just ensure KMS limits are sufficient if API usage spikes.

Name → No material impact; it’s just a tag.

Quick sanity rules

If concurrency (A%) and per-user workload stay proportional, expect ~160× storage and I/O demand when going from 100k → 16M users. In practice, cache hit rates, batching, and tiering can temper this.

Watch instance EBS caps (IOPS/MBps) as closely as per-volume limits—scale out and stripe when you approach ~70–80% of either.

What to do next (fast checklist)

Capacity: Increase Size(GB) and/or number of volumes; plan S3 tiering for warm/cold data.

Performance: Raise IOPS and Throughput(MB) on gp3 or move hot paths to io2; stripe if needed.

Topology: Add more InstanceIDs and spread across AZs.

Quotas: Verify EBS per-Region quotas (volumes, total storage, provisioned IOPS/throughput) and request increases ahead of time.

Cost/latency trade-offs: Prefer gp3 stripes where latency allows; reserve io2 for critical low-latency segments.

If you share a few workload knobs (active-user %, ops/txn, avg I/O size, read/write mix), I can translate this into concrete targets for Size(GB), IOPS, Throughput(MB), #volumes per instance, and volume type mix.
